--- abstract

Remote attestation is a security process in which an entity, acting as the attester, provides evidence to a remote entity, acting as the verifier, in order to demonstrate the integrity and security properties of its software or hardware.
The evidence that is generated by the attester needs to be evaluated and verified by the verifier in order to determine the level of trust and to ensure that the attester has not been compromised or altered.
This document specifies how to perform remote attestation via a very compact and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol EDHOC (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE), based on the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture.

# Introduction

<!--Discuss remote attestation and mention some use cases.-->
Remote attestation is a security process which verifies and confirms the integrity and trustworthiness of a remote device or system in the network.
This process helps establish a level of trust in the remote system before allowing the device to e.g. join the network or access some sensitive information and resources.
The use cases that require remote attestation include secure boot and firmware management, cloud computing, network access control.

<!--Summarize RATS architecture {{RFC9334}} and main roles.-->
The IETF working group Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) has defined an architecture {{RFC9334}} for remote attestation.
The three main roles in the RATS architecture are the Attester, the Verifier and the Relying Party.
The Attester generates the evidence concerning its identity and integrity, which must be appraised by the Verifier for its validity.
Then, the Verifier produces the attestation result, which is consequently used by the Relying Party for the purposes of reliably applying application-specific actions.

<!--Discuss the background check model and say that this specification supports the background check model.-->
One type of interaction model defined in the RATS architecture is called the background-check model.
It resembles the procedure of how employers perform background checks to determine the prospective employee's trustworthiness, by contacting the respective organization that issues a report.
In this case, the employer acts as the Relying Party, the employee acts as the Attester and the organization acts as the Verifier.
The Attester conveys evidence directly to the Relying Party and the Relying Party forwards the evidence to the Verifier for appraisal.
Once the attestation result is computed by the Verifier, it is sent back to the Relying Party to decide what action to take based on the attestation result.
This specification employs the RATS background check model.

<!--Discuss EAT-->
One way of conveying attestation evidence is the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) {{I-D.ietf-rats-eat}}.
It provides an attested claims set that describes the state and the characteristics of the attester, which can be used to determine its level of trustworthiness.
This specification relies on the EAT as the attestation evidence.

<!--Summarize EDHOC {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}}. Mention EAD fields of EDHOC.-->
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}} is a lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for highly constrained networks.
In EDHOC, the two parties involved in the key exchange are referred to as the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).
EDHOC supports the transport of external authorization data, through the dedicated EAD fields.
This specification delivers EAT through EDHOC.
Specifically, EAT is transported as an EAD item.

<!--Discuss implementation aspects such as the internal attestation service running on the Attester.
Root of trust. Separation between secure and non-secure worlds.-->
Typically, the Attester incorporates an internal attestation service, including a specific trusted element known as the "root of trust".
Root of trust serves as the starting point for establishing and validating the trustworthiness appraisals of other components on the system.
The measurements signed by the attestation service are referred to as the Evidence.
The signing is requested through an attestation API.
How the components are separated between the secure and non-secure worlds on a device is out of scope of this specification.

# Conventions and Definitions
{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in EDHOC {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}} and RATS {{RFC9334}}.

# Problem Description

This specification describes how to perform remote attestation over the EDHOC protocol according to the RATS architecture.
Remote attestation protocol elements are carried within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.
More specifically, this specification supports the RATS background check model.
It describes how the Attester (EDHOC Initiator) and Relying Party (EDHOC Responder) complete the EDHOC handshake complemented with remote attestation protocol elements.

# Assumptions

The details of the protocol between Relying Party and Verifier are out of the scope.
The only assumption is that the Verifier outputs a fresh nonce and that same nonce is passed on to the EDHOC session.
That is where the link between the two protocols comes in.
The remainder, such as the evidence type selection is just the negotiation.
In general, the Verifier is supposed to know how to verify more than one format.
However, we assume in this specification, the Relying Party has no knowledge for the appraisal of Evdience, therefore is not involved in the type selection.
So the Verifier will narrow down the selection itself to only one format.


The Attester should have an explicit relation with the Verifier, such as from device manufacuture, so that the Verifier can evaluate the Evidence that is produced by the Attester.

# The Protocol

## Overview

EDHOC Initiator plays the role of the RATS Attester.
EDHOC Responder plays the role of the RATS Relying Party.
An external entity, out of scope of this specification, plays the role of the RATS Verifier.

The Attester and the Relying Party communicate by transporting messages within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.

## External Authorization Data 1 {#ead1}

In EAD_1, the Attester transports the Proposed_EvidenceType object.
EvidenceType signals to the Relying Party the proposal to do remote attestation, as well as which attestation claims the Attester supports.
The supported attestation claims are encoded in CBOR in the form of a sequence.

The external authorization data EAD_1 contains an EAD item with
* ead_label = TBD1
* ead_value = Attestation_proposal, which is a CBOR byte string:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attestation_proposal = bstr .cbor Proposed_EvidenceType

Proposed_EvidenceType = (
	content-format: 	[ + uint]
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* content-format is a list that contains all the supported evidence types in decreasing order of preference.
* There MUST be at least one item in the list.

The sign of ead_label needs to be negative to indicate that the EAT item is critical.
If the receiver cannot recognize the critical EAD item, or cannot process the information in the critical EAD item, then the receiver MUST send an EDHOC error message back.


## External Authorization Data 2 {#ead2}

In EAD_2, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the supported and requested attestation claims.
In case none of the evidence types is supported, the Relying Party rejects the first message_1 with an error indicating support for another evidence type.

EAD_2 carries the Selected_EvidenceType object.
Similarly to EAD_1, Selected_EvideceType object is encoded in CBOR.

The external authorization data EAD_2 contains an EAD item with
* ead_label = TBD2
* ead_value = Attestation_request, which is a CBOR byte string:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attestation_Request = bstr .cbor Selected_EvidenceType
Selected_EvidenceType = (
	content-format:uint,
	nonce:bstr
)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where

* content-format is the selected evidence type by the appraisal entity.
* nonce is generated from the appraisal entity.

## External Authorization Data 3 {#ead3}

As a response to the attestation request, the Attester calls its local attestation service to generate and return the serialized EAT {{I-D.ietf-rats-eat}} as Evidence.
EDHOC uses Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR){{RFC8949}} for encoding, so the EAT in this specification should be encoded in CBOR and built on CBOR Web Token (CWT){{RFC8392}}.

The external authorization data EAD_3 contains an EAD item with
* ead_label = TBD3
* ead_value = Evidence, which is a CBOR byte string:



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Evidence = bstr .cbor eat
eat = {
	+ Claim Key: Claim Value Type
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where eat is composed of one or more Claim key in Claim Value Type, from the "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry{{IANA.CWT.Claims}} .

## EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

IANA has registered the following entry in the "EDHOC External Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over Cose (EDHOC)".
The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds to the ead_value Attestation_proposal in EAD_1 with processing specified in {{ead1}}.
The ead_label = TBD2 corresponds to the ead_value Attestation_request in {{ead2}}.
The ead_label = TBD3 corresponds to the ead_value Evidence in {{ead3}} in this specification.



| Label | Value Type | Description |
| TBD1 | bstr | Attestation Proposal |
| TBD2 | bstr | Attestation Request |
| TBD3 | bstr | Evidence for remote attestation |
