--- abstract

Remote attestation is a security process in which an entity, acting as the attester, provides evidence to a remote entity, acting as the verifier, in order to demonstrate the integrity and security properties of its software or hardware.
The evidence that is generated by the attester needs to be evaluated and verified by the verifier in order to determine the level of trust and to ensure that the attester has not been compromised or altered.
This document specifies how to perform remote attestation via a very compact and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol EDHOC (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE), based on the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture.

# Introduction

<!--Discuss remote attestation and mention some use cases.-->
Remote attestation is a security process which verifies and confirms the integrity and trustworthiness of a remote device or system in the network.
This process helps establish a level of trust in the remote system before allowing the device to e.g. join the network or access some sensitive information and resources.
The use cases that require remote attestation include secure boot and firmware management, cloud computing, network access control.

<!--Summarize RATS architecture {{RFC9334}} and main roles.-->
The IETF working group Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) has defined an architecture {{RFC9334}} for remote attestation.
The three main roles in the RATS architecture are the Attester, the Verifier and the Relying Party.
The Attester generates the evidence concerning its identity and integrity, which must be appraised by the Verifier for its validity.
Then, the Verifier produces the attestation result, which is consequently used by the Relying Party for the purposes of reliably applying application-specific actions.

<!--Discuss the background check model and say that this specification supports the background check model.-->
One type of interaction model defined in the RATS architecture is called the background-check model.
It resembles the procedure of how employers perform background checks to determine the prospective employee's trustworthiness, by contacting the respective organization that issues a report.
In this case, the employer acts as the Relying Party, the employee acts as the Attester and the organization acts as the Verifier.
The Attester conveys evidence directly to the Relying Party and the Relying Party forwards the evidence to the Verifier for appraisal.
Once the attestation result is computed by the Verifier, it is sent back to the Relying Party to decide what action to take based on the attestation result.
This specification employs the RATS background check model.

<!--Discuss EAT-->
One way of conveying attestation evidence is the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) {{I-D.ietf-rats-eat}}.
It provides an attested claims set that describes the state and the characteristics of the attester, which can be used to determine its level of trustworthiness.
This specification relies on the EAT as the attestation evidence.

<!--Summarize EDHOC {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}}. Mention EAD fields of EDHOC.-->
Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}} is a lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for highly constrained networks.
In EDHOC, the two parties involved in the key exchange are referred to as the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).
EDHOC supports the transport of external authorization data, through the dedicated EAD fields.
This specification delivers EAT through EDHOC.
Specifically, EAT is transported as an EAD item.

<!--Discuss implementation aspects such as the internal attestation service running on the Attester.
Root of trust. Separation between secure and non-secure worlds.-->
Typically, the Attester incorporates an internal attestation service, including a specific trusted element known as the "root of trust".
Root of trust serves as the starting point for establishing and validating the trustworthiness appraisals of other components on the system.
The measurements signed by the attestation service are referred to as the Evidence.
The signing is requested through an attestation API.
How the components are separated between the secure and non-secure worlds on a device is out of scope of this specification.

# Conventions and Definitions
{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in EDHOC {{I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc}} and RATS {{RFC9334}}.

# Problem Description

This specification describes how to perform remote attestation over the EDHOC protocol according to the RATS architecture.
Remote attestation protocol elements are carried within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.
More specifically, this specification supports the RATS background check model.
It describes how the Attester (EDHOC Initiator) and Relying Party (EDHOC Responder) complete the EDHOC handshake complemented with remote attestation protocol elements.

# Assumptions

TODO rewrite the assumptions

# The Protocol

## Overview

EDHOC Initiator plays the role of the RATS Attester.
EDHOC Responder plays the role of the RATS Relying Party.
An external entity, out of scope of this specification, plays the role of the RATS Verifier.

The Attester and the Relying Party communicate by transporting messages within EDHOC's External Authorization Data (EAD) fields.

## External Authorization Data 1

In EAD_1, the Attester transports the Proposed_Evidence_Type object.
Evidence_Type signals to the Relying Party the proposal to do remote attestation, as well as which attestation claims the Attester supports.
The supported attestation claims are encoded in CBOR in the form of a sequence.

TODO: Encode Proposed_Evidence_Type as CBOR data structure. See draft-ietf-lake-authz for examples.
TODO: Register with IANA EAD_1 label

## External Authorization Data 2

In EAD_2, the Relying Party signals to the Attester the supported and requested attestation claims.
In case the attestation is not supported, the EDHOC Responder returns an error message.
EAD_2 carries the Request_Attestation object.
Similarly to EAD_1, Request_Attestation object is encoded in CBOR.

TODO: Encode Request_Attestation as CBOR data structure.
TODO: Register with IANA EAD_2 label.

Once the Attester receives EAD_2, it makes a request to its local attestation API to perform attestation.
It uses the nonce generated from the EDHOC handshake, with the following parameters:

* exporter_label is TBD4.
* context is an empty byte string.
* length is 16 bytes.

nonce = EDHOC_Exporter(exporter_label, context, length).

Nonce is passed to the attestation API and used to generate the attestation evidence.
Note that the nonce is not carried in the message, but is rather signed as

## External Authorization Data 3

As a response to the attestation request, the local attestation service returns the serialized EAT.

EAD_3 = EAT
